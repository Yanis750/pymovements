    """Fixation identification based on dispersion threshold (I-DT).

    The algorithm identifies fixations by grouping consecutive points
    within a maximum separation (dispersion) threshold and a minimum duration threshold.
    The algorithm uses a moving window to check the dispersion of the points in the window.
    If the dispersion is below the threshold, the window represents a fixation,
    and the window is expanded until the dispersion is above threshold.

    The implementation and its default parameter values are based on the description and pseudocode
    from Salvucci and Goldberg :cite:p:`SalvucciGoldberg2000`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions: list[list[float]] | list[tuple[float, float]] | np.ndarray
        shape (N, 2)
        Continuous 2D position time series
    timesteps: list[int] | np.ndarray | None
        shape (N, )
        Corresponding continuous 1D timestep time series. If None, sample based timesteps are
        assumed. (default: None)
    minimum_duration: int
        Minimum fixation duration. The duration is specified in the units used in ``timesteps``.
        If ``timesteps`` is None, then ``minimum_duration`` is specified in numbers of samples.
        (default: 100)
    dispersion_threshold: float
        Threshold for dispersion for a group of consecutive samples to be identified as fixation.
        (default: 1.0)
    include_nan: bool
        Indicator, whether we want to split events on missing/corrupt value (np.nan).
        (default: False)
    name: str
        Name for detected events in EventDataFrame. (default: 'fixation')

    Returns
    -------
    EventDataFrame
        A dataframe with detected fixations as rows.
